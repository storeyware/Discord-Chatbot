This README.md acts as the deliverables for our discord chatbot implementation of OpenAI's chatGPT. The index.js portion of this assignment was completed by following a YouTube guide by username [Niconiconnii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkMWVrhGorI) and we encourage you to follow the link to their channel.

### The Goblin
I used to make YouTube videos and stream myself anything between playing videogames and digital illustration. In my streaming days, I had a chatbot that had some simple tasks such as posting my social media links in chat at various intervals and answering commands like !joke by pulling a string from my desktop and dropping it in the life chat for my viewers to enjoy. Eventually I went to school for Computer Science where secretly I hoped to give my little bot a voice using artificial intelligence. This project is that dream's implementation. 

As a fan of goblin lore in various forms of fantasy, I wanted to give GobboBOT a personality to match what I pictured all those years ago. As such he must have the following traits:
- He's got a goblin accent (I'm using the World of Warcraft goblin accent which is similar to a steriotypical New Yorker)
- He's witty, sarcastic, and rude
- He has catch phrases like "Time is money!"
- He knows what he looks like. Short and purple with long pointed ears.

### The Code
<!-- start with walking through the guide in the youtube link perhaps? We'll have to talk about openAI and show snippits of the code. Particularly the prompt. -->

### Discord
<!-- A guide on how to set the bot up in discord. -->

### Testing
<!-- examples of testing trials. Feel free to use the screenshots i posted in discord. I had to write out several different versions of the prompt. Ask me questions!-->

### Conclusion
<!-- shit idk.. suggestions? -->
